# Story
## Why Counter?

### General story/background
Counters can be more frequently used in our daily lives than one may notice. From bigger scale usage like stock taking at a warehouse and head counting at events, counters frequently employed in excercise and fitness such as counting number of rope skips done or flight of stairs climbed. Recentlty, there has also been an uprise of the use of "wooden fish" as a form of meditation. Digital versions have also developed to aid the process and deduce the accumulated knocks on the "wooden fish".

### My personal story/problem
I have recently picked up crocheting as a hobby, there is a need to track the number of stitches as I go along, but it is rather common that I lose track of counting or miscount, resulting in incorrect product ðŸ˜¢.Digital counters are certainly an option, but they can cause more distractions.

PLUS! Why spend money on an analog counter when I have the chance to make my own personal 101% original counter in this project! ðŸ”¥
